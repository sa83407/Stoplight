# Stoplight

The purpose of this lab is to design and implement a Traffic Light Controller using the MSP432 board. Other objectives and skills obtained include understanding linked data structures, creating a segmented software system, and study real-time synchronization by designing a FSM controller. Software skills obtained are the use of the SysTick timer, advanced index addressing, linked data structures, and debugging real-time systems. A Moore state machine format and state diagram was used to implement the system. The software Multisim was used to simulate the system and analyze the circuit.
